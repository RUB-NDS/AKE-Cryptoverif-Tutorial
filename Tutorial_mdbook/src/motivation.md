## What is CryptoVerif?
> formalizes sequence of games (game hopping)  
> computes bound on advantage  
> probabilistic process calculus language (inspired by pi calculus)
> interactive mode  

## Why you should learn about it
> confirm your manual proofs  
> CryptoVerif cannot find attacks BUT failed proof may help you to find such an attack (on a protocol you considered and "proofed" to be secure)

# 💡 Challenges

## Enc-and-MAC

In the first challenge we will consider the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption#Encrypt-and-MAC_(E&M)" target="_blank">Enc-and-MAC</a>
construction. The assumptions on the cryptographic primitives are the same as in the chapter **First Proof**. The symmetric encryption is IND-CPA secure and the MAC is SUF-CMA secure.

**Try** to prove that Enc-and-MAC is IND-CPA secure using CryptoVerif. As you may already know that **cannot be proven** as attacks exist.  
In this challenge you should inspect CryptoVerif´s output and understand why the sequence of games failed.  
Note that CryptoVerif **cannot find attacks**. However, you should use CryptoVerif´s output to derive a concrete attack on the Enc-and-MAC construction.

The Enc-and-MAC construction works as follows.

1. Encrypt the plaintext resulting in a ciphertext.
2. Compute the MAC over the plaintext.
3. Concatenate the ciphertext and this MAC.

You can see a visualization of this construction on the right-hand side.

>    
> In the IND-CPA proof for Enc-then-MAC presented in the chapter **First Proof** we saw that CryptoVerif was able to merge the branches depending on the value of _b_. This was possible as the expressions were semantically the same in both branches.  
> For the Enc-and-MAC construction this is not possible. When you have a look at the highlighted parts in the CryptoVerif output below, you will see that in the upper branch the MAC is computed over the plaintext _m1_ and in the lower branch over the plaintext _m2_. This prevents merging those branches. At this point CryptoVerif does not find another way to prove the secrecy of _b_.

## Enc-then-MAC IND-CCA2

In the second challenge we will consider the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption#Encrypt-and-MAC_(E&M)" target="_blank">Enc-then-MAC</a>
construction again. The assumptions on the cryptographic primitives are the same as in the chapter **First Proof**. The symmetric encryption is IND-CPA secure and the MAC is SUF-CMA secure.  
Your goal is to prove that Enc-then-MAC is then
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability#Indistinguishability_under_chosen_ciphertext_attack/adaptive_chosen_ciphertext_attack_(IND-CCA1,_IND-CCA2)" target="_blank">IND-CCA2</a>
secure using CryptoVerif.


You can orientate yourself on the input file
<a href="https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/CryptoVerif/tutorial/enc-then-MAC-IND-CPA.ocv" target="_blank">_enc-then-MAC-IND-CPA.ocv_</a>
presented in the chapter **First Proof**. You may require to have a look at hints 4 and 5 as they contain CryptoVerif syntax not captured in this tutorial beforehand.

> The Enc-then-MAC decryption function _full\_dec_ has three parameters. It requires the ciphertext _c_ of type _bitstringt_, the encryption key _k_ of type _key_, and the MAC key _mk_ of type _mkey_.  
> First, it separates the ciphertext _c_ of the Enc-then-MAC encryption back to the “regular” ciphertext _c1_ and the MAC _mac1_. If the ciphertext _c_ was of incorrect format and therefore could not be split into _c1_ and _mac1_, the function returns bottom.  
> Then, it is checked whether the MAC _mac1_ is valid. This is done by calling the verification function _verify_ providing the ciphertext _c1_, the MAC key _mk_, and the MAC _mac1_ as parameters. If the verification succeeds, the decryption of the ciphertext _c1_ under the decryption key (same as the encryption key) _k_ is returned. If the verification fails, the function returns bottom.

> The encryption oracle _QencLR_ is almost the same as in the IND-CPA proof presented in the chapter **First Proof**. As we need to give an adversary access to a decryption oracle, we require to prevent that an adversary can win the IND-CCA2 game trivially. That is excluding that an adversary can send a ciphertext produced by the encryption oracle directly to the decryption oracle.  
> We do this by keeping track of the outputed ciphertexts in a table. First, we create a table called _ciphertexts_ which can contain elements of the type _bitstring_. Inside the oracle _Oenc_ we will insert the generated ciphertext _c0_ into the table.
>
> The decryption oracle _Qdec_ has two paramaters. It requires the encryption key _k_ of type _key_ and the MAC key _mk_ of type _mkey_. Similar to the encryption oracle we use oracle replication for the decryption oracle as well. The oracle _Odec_ takes a ciphertext _c_ as input. Note that the decryption oracle is not a left-or-right oracle, so we do not have inputs like _c1_ and _c2_. We check if the ciphertext _c_, queried by the adversary, is inside the table _ciphertexts_ and has thereby been outputed by the encryption oracle earlier. If this is the case the function returns bottom. Otherwise the Enc-then-MAC decryption is returned.

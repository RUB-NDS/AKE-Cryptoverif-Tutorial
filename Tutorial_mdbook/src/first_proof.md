In this chapter we will have a look at a first proof using CryptoVerif. You will be guided to gather an understanding of how to work with CryptoVerif.  

We will consider the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption#Encrypt-then-MAC_(EtM)" target="_blank">Enc-then-Mac</a>
construction. Our goal is to show that Enc-then-Mac is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability#Indistinguishability_under_chosen-plaintext_attack_(IND-CPA)" target="_blank">IND-CPA</a>
secure, assuming the symmetric encryption is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability#Indistinguishability_under_chosen-plaintext_attack_(IND-CPA)" target="_blank">IND-CPA</a>
secure and the MAC is

secure.

## Enc-then-Mac

<img style="float:right" src="img/EncThenMac.png" alt="Could not load image.">

The Enc-then-Mac construction works as follows.

1. Encrypt the plaintext resulting in a ciphertext.
2. Compute the Mac over this ciphertext.
3. Concatenate the ciphertext and this Mac.

You can see a visualization of this construction on the right-hand side.




## Input file
In this section we will build the input file for the proof together. CryptoVerif takes this file and tries to prove the queries we defined using the sequence of games technique.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that we will not strictly walk through every line of code from the top to the bottom. We will skip some lines for didactic reasons and explain them at the appropriate places.


### Cryptographic assumptions
We start with the cryptographic assumptions we make for the cryptographic primitives used. In our case this is that the symmetric encryption is IND-CPA secure and the MAC is SUF-CMA secure.

CryptoVerif provides a library containing many standard cryptographic assumptions you can use (see
<a href="https://github.com/cn-lk666/CryptoVerif/blob/main/manual.pdf" target="_blank">manual</a>
, Chapter 6). But you can also create your own assumptions.

You can see the code snippets for telling CryptoVerif that _enc_ is IND-CPA secure and _mac_ is SUF-CMA secure in the following.

Here the already in the default library _default.ocvl_ defined macros _IND\_CPA\_sym\_enc_ and _SUF\_CMA\_det\_mac_ are expanded. For a better understanding we will discuss the technical side with the example of the _IND\_CPA\_sym\_enc_ marco.

First, let us inspect the meaning of the arguments of this macro.

1. type of keys
2. type of plaintexts
3. type of ciphertexts
4. encryption function
5. decryption function
6. function to inject bottom symbol (decryption function needs to return bottom when decryption fails; bottom is not the same type as ciphertexts)
7. function that returns for each bitstring a bitstring of the same length consisting only of zeroes
8. probability of breaking the IND-CPA property

The functions _enc_, _dec_, _injbot_ and _Z_ are declared by the macro. It is important that they are not declared anywhere else. They can only be used after the macro has been expanded.

The types of keys, plaintexts, ciphertexts and the probability _Penc_ must be declared before expanding the macro.  
As you can see in the code snippet, the probability _Penc_ is declared right before expanding the macro.  
The types of plaintexts and ciphertexts are _bitstring_, a predefined type.  
The type of keys is declared at the top of the input file, depicted in the following code snippet. There are also the type declarations for arguments for the macro _SUF\_CMA\_det\_mac_.

![Could not load image.](img/FirstProof_Types.png)

The types are annotated with the lable **[fixed]** meaning that, for example, an encryption key is a bitstring of fixed length. Note that CryptoVerif does not need to know the specific length. Similar as it does not need to know the specific implementation of the symmetric encryption scheme or the MAC.

> explain technical side: e.g. IND-CPA replaces plaintexts with Z(m1),Z(m2) (same bitstring)  

Now we want to gain a better understanding of how CryptoVerif is doing game transformations. Once again, we will take the IND-CPA assumption as an example.  
Let¬¥s have a look at a code snippet from the macro _IND\_CPA\_sym\_enc_ in the default library _default.ocvl_ depicted below.

### Definition Enc-then-Mac
<!---Correct description of letfun and fun?--->
> letfun full_enc()  
> letfun requires implementation vs fun does not

Further, we need to define how Enc-then-Mac works. Otherwise CryptoVerif would not know what the construction we try to prove looks like. 

For the definition of the Enc-then-Mac construction we will need a function for concatenation. We will start with this function.  
There are different types of functions in CryptoVerif. In this code snippet we can see **letfun**. Another type of functions is **fun**. The difference between them is that **letfun** requires to contain a concrete implementation of the function, whereas **fun** only defines the input- and output-types.  

The definition of the concatenation function is shown in the following.

> talk about fun, types and [data]


Now that we talked about the concatenation function, we have everything we need to move on to the Enc-then-Mac construction. The definition of the Enc-then-Mac encryption is depicted in the following.

![Could not load image.](img/FirstProof_EncThenMac.png)
 
As we want to define the exact behaviour for the Enc-then-Mac encryption we use **letfun** for the function _full\_enc_.  

> TODO: talk about oracles ()= and where to put ";" and "."  
> sequential execution with ";"

The function has three arguments that are needed.  
First, there is the plaintext _m_ of type _bitstring_. In CryptoVerif we usually consider plain- and ciphertexts as bitstrings. This means we consider cryptographic primitives (e.g. encryption) as mappings from bitstrings to bitstrings.  
Further there are the encryption key _k_ of type _key_, and the MAC key _mk_ of type _mkey_.

We will use the encryption function _enc_ declared inside of the macro _IND\_CPA\_sym\_enc_ to compute the encryption of the plaintext _m_ under the encryption key _k_. This ciphertext is then stored inside the variable _c1_.  
Next, we concatenate the ciphertext _c1_ with the MAC of the ciphertext _c1_ under the MAC key _mk_. This concatenation is the result of our Enc-then-Mac encryption function _full\_enc_.


### Initial game to prove (including oracles)
Now we want to define the initial game CryptoVerif should try to proof using the sequence of games. In our example this is the IND-CPA game. Note that for many games there are oracles the adversary can query. Here, an encryption oracle from the IND-CPA game is required. We will start with this oracle before proceeding with the initial game.  

> QencLR (oracle)  difference = and :=

The code of the encryption oracle is depicted below.

> talk about keyword **let** and oracles  
> talk about equivalency of IND-CPA and LoR-CPA

The oracle is implemented as a left-or-right oracle. That means that the oracle receives two plaintexts in each query made by the adversary and always encrypts the left plaintext or always encrypts the right plaintext depending on the value of _b_.
